# OpenRoom
OpenRoom is a mobile and web application for finding available rooms at the University of Victoria. Room availability is gathered from UVicâ€™s website and includes lecture halls, labs, and study rooms, but may not include all rooms on campus. Some key features of OpenRoom include: searching for a room available at a specified time or for a length of time, looking up a building to check room availability, and checking the booking schedule for a specific room.

## Motivation
The concept of OpenRoom was inspired by the difficulties UVic students encounter when trying to find a space on campus to have group meetings/discussions/study sessions.
